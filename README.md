# New-York-City-Taxi-data
The goal of this assignment is to transforme and analyse 8 years’ worth of data on NYC taxi trips stored in Microsoft Azure storage to cleaned data by using  Databricks. 
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is the agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City’s taxi cabs since 1971. TLC has publicly published millions of trip records from both yellow and green taxi cabs. 
Each record includes fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, trip distances, itemised fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

Yellow taxi cabs are the iconic taxi vehicles from New York city that have the right to pick up street-hailing passengers anywhere in the city. There are around 13,600 authorised taxis in New York City and each taxi must have a yellow medallion affixed to it. 

Green taxis were introduced in August 2013 to improve taxi service and availability in the boroughs. Green taxis may respond to street hails, but only in certain designated areas.
